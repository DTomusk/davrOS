Boot process:
	1. BIOS transfers control to MBR bootloader in 0000:7c00h (hence bootloader org 0x7c00h)
	2. setup machine environment 
	3. load kernel:
		a. read from disk
		b. save it into main memory
		c. jump to the starting address of the kernel to execute 

Bare bones bootloader: 
; ************************************************************************************************
org 	0x7c00h		; the address BIOS is looking for a bootloader in 
bits 	16			; specify 16 bit mode 
start:	jmp boot 	; run the bootloader (not necessary here as boot is immediately under start)

boot:
	cli		; clear interrupt flag, no interrupts 
	cld		; clear direction flag (DF in EFLAGS) "causes all subsequent string operations to increment the index registers ESI &| EDI"
	hlt		; halt, all the bootloader does is shut down gracefully 

tims 510 - ($-$$) 	db	0	; set all remaining bytes up to 510 to be 0 (so file is 512 long)
dw 	0xAA55	; assign a word (two bytes) at the end of the file for the boot signature 
; ************************************************************************************************

Running the bootloader: 
	1. nasm -f bin bootloader.asm -o bootloader 
		(-f bin specifies the file format, -o indicates that the output file is called bootloader)
	2. dd if=/dev/zero of=disk.img bs=512 count=2880 
		(dev/zero "provides as many null characters as are read from it", which essentially means the input is 512 0s per block and 2880 blocks. dd is a command line utility for converting and copying files, bs sets the blocksize and count the number of blocks, which means the final floppy disk created is 1474560 bytes (1.5MB))
	3. dd conv=notrunc if=bootloader of=disk.img bs=512 count=1 seek=0
		(notrunc means that the disk.img isn't truncated to fit just one 512 byte block but rather retains its 1.5MB size. We take the object file created by the nasm command (1) and write it to our floppy disk in the first sector (as specified by seek=0))
	4. qemu-system-i386 -machine q35 -fda disk.img -gdb tcp::26000 -S 
		(qemu is an open source emulator, here it's emulating a q35 machine which has an i386 architecture, we have one input floppy disk(the disk.img we've created) and we're hooking up gdb (GNU debugger) over port 26000, -S tells qemu to hold off on booting until we've connected over tcp via gdb)
		(this command will produce a warning saying that image format is not specified but that can safely be ignored in this case and if everything is typed out correctly then a qemu window should pop up)
	* run gdb in a new terminal window to connect to qemu 
	5. (gdb) set architecture i8086 
		informs gdb of what architecture to expect, we're using i8086 because we're in 16 bit mode (as per the bootloader)
	6. (gdb) target remote localhost:26000 
		Connects as specified in the qemu call (4)
	7. (gdb) b *0x7c00 
		Set a break point at the address (the asterisk indicates that it's an address and not a symbol in the program itself)
	8. (gdb) layout asm
		allows us to view the assembly code
	9. (gdb) layout reg
		allows us to view the registers in real time 

At this point the bootloader should be running successfully, although it doesn't do much (not that we should expect it to at this point)

; ************************************************************************************************

Modifying the bootloader:
	We want the bootloader to do something itself before we start loading the OS, like printing a message for example. There are a number of interrupts we can call to have the bootloader print a message: 

	int 10h / ah = 02h (set cursor position)
		inputs:
			dh = row 
			dl = column 
			bh = page number ; not sure what pages are, so I'm gonna stick to 0 

		usage (set cursor position to 10,10):
			mov		dh, 10
			mov		dh, 10
			mov 	bh, 0
			mov 	ah, 2
			int 	10h

	int 10h / ah = 0Ah (write character only at cursor position)
		inputs: 
			al = character
			bh = page number
			cx = number of times to write character
		usage:
			mov		al, 66 ; decimal 66, should give 'B', haven't tested yet
			mov		bh, 0
			mov		cx, 1
			mov		ah, 0ah
			int 	10h

	printing a string could be done by repeatedly calling 0ah and updating the cursor with 02h, but there is also an interrupt for writing strings:

	int 10h / 13h (write string)
		inputs:
			al = write mode (two bits, bit 0 for updating cursor and bit 1 for strings with attributes, I'm gonna generally be using 1 so bit 1 is empty)
			bh = page number 
			bl = attribute if string contains only characters (not sure what this should be but example given is 0011_1011b)
			cx = number of characters in string (length)
			dl,dh = coordinate of start (column, row)
			es:bp = address of string 

		usage (example given in referred document):
			mov		al, 1
			mov		bh, 0
			mov		bl, 0011_1011b
			mov 	cx, msg1end - offset msg1
			mov 	dl, 10
			mov		dh, 7
			push 	cs
			pop		es
			mov		bp, offset msg1end		; offset in x86 means we're accessing the address of msg1end and not the value it contains, that is we're moving an address into bp (equivalent to lea bp, msg1end)
			mov 	ah, 13h
			int 	10h
			jmp 	msg1end					; don't try to execute the assignment 
			msg1 	db " hello, world! "	; there's no separate sections for variable like .text 
			msg1end:

(My reference for the interrupts was: https://issuu.com/stellachristou/docs/i8086_and_dos_interrupts accessed on 30/06/20)

Using bootloader to load a program:
	A real bootloader must read and load an operating system
	(I hadn't really looked into kernels earlier but I felt I should now. A kernel is the core of the operating system which basically controls everything, it facilitates communication between hardware and software. A kernel runs processes, manages hardware resources, handles interrupts and so on)

	Floppy disks:
		A floppy disk is a form of persistent storage 
		The smallest unit of a floppy disk that can be read is called a sector, a group of 512 contiguous bytes (as we've seen in the floppy disk we created)
		A group of 18 sectors is a track which radiate outward and a side of a floppy disk consists of 80 tracks arranged in a disk
		A floppy drive is needed to read a floppy disk, it has two heads, one for either side 
		A floppy drive alternates sides as it writes data onto tracks 

		Reading data: interrupt 13 / ah = 02 
			al = number of sectors to be read
			ch = track number 
			cl = sector number
			dh = head number
			dl = drive number 
			es:bx = pointer to buffer 

		which returns:
			ah = status 
			al = number of sectors read 
			cf = exit code (0 if successful, 1 if error)

		updated bootloader.asm:

	mov 	ch, 0	; track 0
	mov 	cl, 2	; read the second sector 
	mov 	dh, 0	; read with head 0
	mov 	dl, 0	; drive 0 

	mov 	ah, 0x02	; interrupt code 
	int 	0x13		; call interrupt 
	jmp 	0x50:0x0 	; jump to OS location 

	hlt

times 510 - ($-$$) db 0
dw 	0xAA55
; ************************************************************************************************

	For the purpose of demonstration, write an assembly program for the bootloader to run:

	;***** sample.asm
	mov 	eax, 1
	add 	eax, 1
	;*****

	Compiled and written to disk the same way as our bootloader, but now to the second sector:

		nasm -f bin sample.asm -o sample

		dd if=sample of=disk.img bs=512 count=1 seek=1

	If we run the qemu command now the bootloader should run sample.asm which means we've successfully loaded an OS (of sorts) using our bootloader which already successfully gets called by the emulated BIOS

; ************************************************************************************************

Running commands with makefiles:
	
	Whenever we want to run our bootloader or make any modifications we need to call the same commands to create object files, create the floppy disk, write to the disk and start up qemu 

	We can use scripts to cut all this repetition out so running a modified bootloader requires far fewer and far shorter commands 

	GNU Make is a build system which automates the process of linking files 

	Make rules:
		A rule consists of the following shape: 
			target ... : prerequisites ... 
				recipe
				...
				...
		A target is usually a file name generated by the program (such as executable or object files). A target can also be the name of an action to carry out 

		A prerequisite is a file that's used as an input to create the target, there will usually be multiple prerequisites 

		A recipe is an action carried out by make, it's essentially a set of commands (we can pretty much copy and paste the calls we make in the terminal and use them as recipes)

		A rule explains how and when to remake certain files 

		When calling make, make starts with the first target (the default goal). You can also call make with specific targets 

		Other rules get processed because their targets are prerequisites of other rules 

	make -C tells make to execute another make with a makefile in a supplied directory 

	Make syntax:
		VAR=1	variable assignment with textual value
		VAR=$$(expr)	assignment with expression executed in bash
		PATH := $VAR:/path/ 	declaration and assignment where other variables can be brought in
		PATH += bin/	append to the end of a variable 
		CFLAGS ?= -o 	conditional referencing, if undefined set value, otherwise do nothing 
		OBJS := $(SRC:.o=.c)	substitution reference, .c get replaced with .o from SRC

Automated debugging with GDB

	Debugging with GDB can be very repetitive, so scripts can be written for it as well 
	When gdb starts up it first loads the .gdbinit in the root directory 

	functions in .gdbinit are defined using the define keyword 

	commands in a gdb command file (and so also in init files) are written sequentially as they are to be executed, they take the same form as you would write them in the terminal
